This App is The exercise on react
Up to this point i feel quite well about react overall
issues that i have faced and got solved
1- The bigger picture of react and how to create something big from small component
2- the data flow espically from child to parent i get it now (the answer is 'we are passing a pointer to a function not a whole function so it doesn't matter where it's gonna be
executed it depends on where the state gonna change so don't overwhelme yourself')
issuses that hasn't solved yet (That i remember about)
1- component Life Cycle
2- redux
